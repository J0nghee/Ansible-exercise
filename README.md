# Ansible-exercise

  
**How the vagrant process work**:
When ansible is defined as the provisioner in the Vagrantfile it use the mentioned playbook to config the guest machine.

  

So it's vagrant (not ansible) that execute that playbook on guest machines.

When hit `vagrant up` it creates an inventory for ansible:

    ➜ Ansible-exercise git:(master) ✗ cat .vagrant/provisioners/ansible/inventory/vagrant_ansible_inventory
    
     # Generated by Vagrant
    
    default ansible_host=127.0.0.1 ansible_port=2200 ansible_user='vagrant' ansible_ssh_private_key_file='/home/giogio/Ansible-exercise/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key'
